    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
    <p>
      In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get
      around the royal gardens faster: two samesize inline-wheels , in front one
      steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was
      propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself
      and the device forward in a sort of gliding work.

      The machine become khown as the Draisienne or hobby horse. It was made
      entirely of wood. They enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not
      being practical for transportation in any other place than a well
      maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.

      The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when
      pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as
      the velocipede(meaning "fast foot") as well as the bone shaker, since it's
      wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for
      an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding
      academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities.
