    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>

    <div class="column1of2">
      <h3>The First Bicycle</h3>
      <p>
        In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him
        get around the royal gardens faster: two same-size in-line wheels, the
        front one steerable, mounted in a frame which you straddled. The device
        was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling
        yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.
      </p>
      <p>
        The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was
        made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad,
        not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well
        maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.

      <h3>Further Innovations</h3>
      <p>
        The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when
        pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known
        as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker",
        since it's wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the
        day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and
        indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in
        large cities.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. (Prior to this, metallurgy
        was not advanced enough to provide metal which was strong enough to make
        small, light parts out of.) The pedals were attached directly to front wheel
        with no freewheeling mechanism. Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of
        large front wheel provided a much smoother ride than its predecessor.
